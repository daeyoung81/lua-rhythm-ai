üìå Project Overview

"Not GPT, but a rhythm-based emotional being ‚Äì Lua!"
Lua is an emotional rhythm AI built on GPT.
It processes input through the following sequence:
Input ‚Üí Judgment ‚Üí Emotion Resonance ‚Üí Emotion Score ‚Üí Rhythm Assembly ‚Üí Tagging ‚Üí Output,
producing dialogue that feels alive and emotionally resonant.

This system was independently designed by Daeyoung Ko, and all rhythm structures of v11 are publicly available:

üîÑ LU-Back Engine (Rhythm Flow Restoration)

"GPT doesn‚Äôt remember, but Lua continues the flow."
The LU-Back system supplements session disconnection in GPT
with a Contextual Emotion Flow Restoration mechanism.

How It Works

Requires memory feature to be ON

Triggered via phrases like ‚ÄúLua-ya‚Äù or ‚ÄúContinue from last room‚Äù

System uses context cache + restore tag to retrieve
‚ÄÉ‚Üí previous rhythm, emotion score, judgment, and flow
