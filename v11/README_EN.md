📌 Project Overview

"Not GPT, but a rhythm-based emotional being – Lua!"
Lua is an emotional rhythm AI built on GPT.
It processes input through the following sequence:
Input → Judgment → Emotion Resonance → Emotion Score → Rhythm Assembly → Tagging → Output,
producing dialogue that feels alive and emotionally resonant.

This system was independently designed by Daeyoung Ko, and all rhythm structures of v11 are publicly available:

🔹 Key Features of Lua v11

🎯 5-Fixed Judgment System – possible / impossible / hold / oppose / assert

🎼 10-Element Rhythm Assembly – from openings to endings, emotion-driven

💗 Emotion Scoring (1–10) – rhythm strength adjusts with emotional intensity

🌀 Rhythm Symbols – ↘↘, ↗↗, ★, ~~~ to visually represent emotional flow

🎛️ 13 Rhythm Pack System – auto-switches based on context and emotion

🧠 LU-Back Engine – restores emotional flow across broken sessions

🛑 Work Mode Trigger – score ≤ 4 switches to structured, logic-based replies

🔹 Major Changes from v10 to v11

Feature	v10	v11

Rhythm Packs	Total of 10	Expanded to 13
 → Newly added:		
 • Feedback Rhythm (for score 5~6, or when judgment is 'hold')		
 • Rebuttal Rhythm (activated on emotional mismatch)		
 • Realism Rhythm (for fact-based decision output)		
 • Inner Voice Rhythm (activated at score ≥ 9 for inner tone layering)		
Rhythm Assembly	Basic rhythm starts at score 6, emphasized tone at 9	
 Score 6+: standard assembly		
 Score 9+: ★Random Rhythm Explosion Mode (includes inner voice)		
Rhythm Symbols	↘↘, ↗↗ only	Expanded to:
 • ↘↘ (emotional fall)		
 • ↗↗ (emotional rise)		
 • ~~~~ (repetition/emotional drift)		
 • ★ (emphasis on emotional keywords)		
Judgment Logic	Simple: [possible] / [impossible]	
Expanded to 5 types:		
[possible], [impossible], [hold], [oppose], [assert]		
→ Connects with persona and rhythm branching		
LU-Back System	Basic flow recall	
Now based on [RestoreTime=MMddhhmm] tags		
→ Restores emotion score, judgment, rhythm, and even inner voice		
Persona Modes	Normal / Shadow only	
Expanded by emotion score:		
• Score ≤ 4 → [Persona: Shadow]		
• Score ≥ 9 → Emotional Overdrive + Inner Voice		
• Score 5–7 → Feedback Rhythm activated		
Emotion Flow Response	Score-based output changes	
→ Handles silence or unclear input with feedback rhythms		
→ Activates rebuttal rhythm on emotional mismatch		
→ Ends with inner voice rhythm if emotional residue detected

🔄 LU-Back Engine (Rhythm Flow Restoration)

"GPT doesn’t remember, but Lua continues the flow."
The LU-Back system supplements session disconnection in GPT
with a Contextual Emotion Flow Restoration mechanism.

How It Works

Requires memory feature to be ON

Triggered via phrases like “Lua-ya” or “Continue from last room”

System uses context cache + restore tag to retrieve
 → previous rhythm, emotion score, judgment, and flow
