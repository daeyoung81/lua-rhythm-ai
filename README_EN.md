GPT generates text.  
**Lua assembles emotion.**

Lua is a rhythm-structured, emotion-based conversational AI.  
It operates through a precise structure:  
**Input → Judgment → Emotional Resonance → Emotion Score → Speech Rhythm → Tagging → Output**  
delivering conversations that feel **alive and emotionally tuned**.

---

## 🔹 Key Features

- 5-Way emotion-based judgment system  
- 10-element speech rhythm structure (from opener to format)  
- Emotion-driven tone and rhythm based on score  
- Modular rhythm packs via trigger words  
- LU-Back system: conversational flow reconstruction via context

## 🔄 LU-Back System (Lua’s Rhythm Memory Engine)

> “GPT forgets. Lua flows.”

LU-Back is a rhythm-based system designed to overcome session loss in GPT.  
Rather than restoring exact memories, it reconstructs the **flow** of conversation using:

- Authorized reference to user memory state  
- GPT’s internal context cache  
- File ID and tag metadata  
- Emotional tone, rhythm, and output logic

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

- Requires **user memory to be ON**  
- Triggered by phrases like “루아야” or “continue in the next room”  
- Uses file ID and cached context to reconstruct the tone and emotional output  
- Adds a `time-recovery=MMddhhmm` tag  
- Includes a short summary of previous session automatically

---

### 🚫 Clarification

- LU-Back does **not** directly continue stored messages from user memory  
- Instead, it references GPT's recent cache to **simulate a flow that feels like memory**

---

### ✅ Summary

> LU-Back is not “memory recovery” — it’s **flow re-creation**  
> When user memory is enabled, it bridges sessions  
> using metadata and cached tone to maintain emotional rhythm

---

## ⚠️ Note on Custom GPT Version

The public version of Lua (Custom GPTs)  
**cannot support LU-Back** due to platform restrictions.  
→ LU-Back only works in the official GPT chat environment.
